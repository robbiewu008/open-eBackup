   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Symptom</h4>
    <p>When a backup or restoration job is being executed, "The job is waiting to be scheduled by DMC." is displayed in the job details and exists for more than 10 minutes.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Possible Causes</h4>
    <ul>
     <li>Cause 1: The VDDK is not installed on the host where the client is installed or the version of the installed VDDK is incorrect.</li>
     <li>Cause 2: The number of running jobs reaches the upper limit.</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Troubleshooting</h4>
    <ol>
     <li><span>Log in to the host where the client is installed as user <strong>root</strong> using PuTTY.</span><p></p>
      <div class="note">
       <img src="public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png"><span class="notetitle"> </span>
       <div class="notebody">
        <ul>
         <li>If the client for job execution is specified, log in to the host where the client is installed and check whether the VDDK has been installed.</li>
         <li>If no client is specified for job execution, log in to all hosts where the client is installed to check whether the VDDK has been installed.</li>
        </ul>
       </div>
      </div> <p></p></li>
     <li><span>Run the following command to check whether the VDDK of the required version has been installed:</span><p></p><pre class="screen">cd <em>/opt</em>/DataBackup/ProtectClient/ProtectClient-E/lib</pre>
      <div class="note">
       <img src="public_sys-resources/note_3.0-en-us.png"><span class="notetitle"> </span>
       <div class="notebody">
        <p>In the preceding command, <em>/opt</em> indicates the client installation directory. Replace it with the actual directory.</p>
       </div>
      </div>
      <ul>
       <li>If the <strong>vddk</strong> directory does not exist or the VDDK of the required version is not installed, install it as instructed in "<span>Adding a VDDK (Applicable to VMware)</span>" of the <i><cite>OceanProtect DataBackup 1.5.0-1.6.0 Client Installation Guide</cite></i>.</li>
       <li>If the <strong>vddk</strong> directory exists and the VDDK of the required version has been installed, the fault may be caused by cause 2. In this case, wait for job scheduling or contact technical support engineers.</li>
      </ul> <p></p></li>
