   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Symptom</h4>
    <p>A full backup copy is used to restore a VMware VM to the original location on a new host. After the restoration is successful and the new VM is successfully started, one of the following exceptions occurs:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The operating system fails to start. If information similar to the following is displayed when the operating system starts, the <strong>/dev/sdc1</strong> partition cannot be mounted. In practice, the partition may be mounted on another device.<pre class="screen">EXT4-fs (sdc1): no journal found</pre></li>
     <li>The system enters the emergency mode. In emergency mode, run the <strong>journal -p err</strong> command. If information similar to the following is displayed, the boot partition cannot be mounted:<pre class="screen">failed to mount /boot</pre></li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Possible Causes</h4>
    <p>A disk fails to be mounted in the full copy because the <strong>inode</strong> information in the first block group of the disk is modified.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Troubleshooting</h4>
    <ol>
     <li><span>Check whether the problem is caused by the failure to mount some data disks or system disks on the VM.</span><p></p>
      <div class="p">
       This section uses the <strong>/dev/sdc1</strong> device as an example. In the actual situation, other devices may be not found.
       <ol type="a">
        <li>Log in to the protected VM and enter the maintenance mode as prompted.</li>
        <li>Run the following command to check whether automatic mounting upon system startup has been enabled for the faulty disk:<pre class="screen">cat /etc/fstab</pre> <p>If information similar to the following is displayed, automatic mounting upon system startup has been enabled:</p> <pre class="screen">/dev/sdc1    /opt/hr/sdc1                 ext3     defaults       0 0</pre></li>
        <li>Run the following command to check whether the disk is mounted:<pre class="screen">mount | grep "dev/sd"</pre> <p>If the mounting information about <strong>/dev/sdc1</strong> does not exist, the disk is not mounted.</p></li>
        <li>Run the following command to check whether the device exists:<pre class="screen">fdisk -l | grep "<em>dev/sdc1</em>"</pre> <p>If no command output is displayed, the disk does not exist.</p></li>
        <li>If the disk exists but is not mounted, go to <a href="#EN-US_TOPIC_0000002164814002__li13985042204812">2</a>. Otherwise, contact technical support for assistance.</li>
       </ol>

      <ul>
       <li>If the XFS file system is used, run the following commands:<pre class="screen">xfs_repair -L <em>/dev/sdc1</em></pre> <pre class="screen">xfs_repair <em>/dev/sdc1</em></pre></li>
       <li>For other file systems, run the following command:<pre class="screen">fsck -v <em>/dev/sdc1</em></pre></li>
      </ul> <p></p></li>
     <li><span>Run the following command to restart the VM:</span><p></p><pre class="screen">reboot</pre> <p></p></li>
     <li><span>Run the following command to check whether the disk is mounted successfully:</span><p></p><pre class="screen">mount | grep "<em>/dev/sdc1</em>"</pre> <p>If you can access the operating system and the mounting information about <strong>/dev/sdc1</strong> exists, the fault is rectified.</p> <p></p></li>
