  <div>
   <p>DeviceManager is a piece of integrated storage management software developed by Huawei. On any management terminal connected to the storage system, you can use a browser to log in to DeviceManager as a local user using the management network port IP address of the controller of the storage system.</p>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Prerequisites</h4>
    <p>Before using DeviceManager, check whether the management terminal meets the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Compatibility of the operating system and browser running on the management terminal<p>DeviceManager supports multiple operating systems and browsers. For details about the compatibility information, visit <a href="https://info.support.huawei.com/storage/comp/#/oceanprotect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compatibility Query</a>.</p></li>
     <li>The communication between the management terminal and storage device is normal.</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Context</h4>
    <ul>
     <li>This section uses the Windows operating system as an example to describe how to log in to DeviceManager. The DeviceManager login operations on other operating systems need to be adjusted accordingly.</li>
     <li>If the current user does not perform any operation within the session timeout period (30 minutes by default, which can be modified), the system automatically exits and the user needs to log in again.</li>
     <li>If a non-super administrator has not logged in to the storage system for a period of time (60 days by default, which can be modified), the account will be locked and can be unlocked only by the super administrator. The unlocking method is as follows:<p>Log in to DeviceManager as the super administrator and choose <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>User and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Users and Roles</strong> &gt; <strong>User Management</strong> to go to the <strong>User Management</strong> page. In the row where the name of the user to be unlocked resides, choose <strong>More</strong> &gt; <strong>Unlock</strong>.</p>

       <div class="notebody">
        <p>If the super administrator chooses <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>User and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Security Policies</strong> and selects <strong>Lock Account When Idle</strong>, a non-super administrator account will be locked only when the account has not logged in to the system for a specified period of time.</p>

    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Procedure</h4>
    <ol>
     <li><span>Open a browser on the management terminal.</span></li>
     <li><span>Type <strong>https://</strong><em>IPv4 address</em><strong>:8088</strong> or <strong>https://[</strong><em>IPv6 address</em><strong>]:8088</strong> in the address box and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span><p></p>

       <div class="notebody">
        <ul>
         <li><em>IPv4 address</em> and <em>IPv6 address</em> indicate the DeviceManager management IP address of the storage system.</li>
         <li>If a firewall is configured, you must enable port <strong>8088</strong> for the system to provide web services.</li>
         <li>The browser may prompt that the website has a security certificate issue. If the IP address is correct, you can neglect the prompt and continue accessing the storage system.</li>
         <li>If you have an available security certificate, you are advised to run related commands to import the certificate to further improve system security.</li>
