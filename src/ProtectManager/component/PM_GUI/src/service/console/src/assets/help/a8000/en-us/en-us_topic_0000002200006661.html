<h1 class="topictitle1">After Consistent Backup Is Enabled, Snapshots Cannot Be Created Due to Insufficient Logical Volume Space, and the Backup Job Is Converted to Non-consistent Backup (for Linux OS)</h1>
<div><div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Symptom</h4><p>In a backup job, a message is displayed, indicating that the space of the logical volume group (<em>Logical volume group name</em>) is insufficient and therefore, no snapshot can be created and backup of the volume group is converted to non-consistent backup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Possible Causes</h4><p>Consistent backup supports only LVM volumes. You can create a snapshot for the LVM volume to which the path selected for the backup fileset belongs and back up data based on the snapshot volume to achieve consistent backup. When creating a snapshot for an LVM volume, ensure that the remaining space of the volume group to which the LVM volume belongs is greater than 5% of the space of the LVM volume where the backup is performed. Otherwise, the snapshot fails to be created and the backup job is converted to a non-consistent backup job.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Troubleshooting</h4><ol><li><span>Use PuTTY to log in to the host where the fileset data protection client is installed as user <strong>root</strong>.</span><p><p>This section uses the SUSE 15 SP2 OS as an example. The commands for other OSs may vary.</p>
</p></li><li id="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002200006661__li2498143745813"><a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002200006661__li2498143745813"></a><a name="li2498143745813"></a><span>Run the following command to check the remaining space of the logical volume group:</span><p><pre class="screen">vgs</pre>
<div class="p">Information similar to the following is displayed. The error message of the backup job displays the name of the logical volume group with insufficient space. In this example, the logical volume group name is <strong>system</strong>, and the remaining space of the logical volume group is 1.9 GB.<pre class="screen">suse15sp2:~ # vgs
  VG     #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize  VFree
  system   1   9   2 wz--n- 99.51g 1.90g</pre>
</div>
</p></li><li><span>Run the following command to query the disk space corresponding to the protection path:</span><p><pre class="screen">df -h</pre>
<div class="p">Information similar to the following is displayed. During the backup, the remaining space of the logical volume group must be greater than 5% of the disk space where the protection path is located. Use the command output as an example. If the protection path is the root directory <em>/</em>, the corresponding disk space is 49 GB, the 5% disk space is 2.45 GB, and the remaining space of the logical volume group queried in <a href="#EN-US_TOPIC_0000002200006661__li2498143745813">2</a> is 1.90 GB. In this case, snapshots cannot be created, and backup of the volume group is converted to non-consistent backup.<pre class="screen">suse15sp2:~ # df -h
