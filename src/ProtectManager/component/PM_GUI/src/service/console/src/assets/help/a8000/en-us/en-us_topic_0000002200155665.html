With correct system time, you can accurately determine the alarm generation time based on alarm logs. You can synchronize the client time to the system and set Network Time Protocol (NTP) automatic synchronization or manually change the system time. After configuring the device time, you must restart all <span id="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002200155665__text1024332181217">OceanProtect</span> services. Otherwise, data protection jobs will fail to be delivered.</p>
