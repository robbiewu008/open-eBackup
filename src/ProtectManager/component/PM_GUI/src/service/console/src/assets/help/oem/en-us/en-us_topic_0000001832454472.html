   <ul>
    <li>Full backup: backs up all data of resources at the current time point.</li>
    <li>Log backup: backs up TiDB cluster logs.</li>
    <li>Copy verification: verifies the integrity of a copy after the backup is complete or before the copy is used for restoration.</li>
    <li>Source deduplication: reduces the amount of data to be transmitted, but occupies more client resources.</li>
    <li>Transmission and storage encryption: adopts the AES256 encryption algorithm to encrypt backup data.</li>
