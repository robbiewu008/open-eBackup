  <div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Symptom</h4>
    <p>The backup or restoration fails. The following error information can be found in the log of the backup agent:</p>
    <p>Failed to establish connection with the NetBackup master server. Error: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='xxx.server', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /netbackup/security/ping (Caused by NewConnectionError('&lt;urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7f9e466b0ef0&gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known',))</p>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Possible Causes</h4>
    <p>During the backup or restoration, the backup agent host needs to connect to the ESXi host that can access the disk. However, the domain name of the target ESXi host cannot be identified by the backup agent.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Troubleshooting</h4>
    <ol>
     <li><span>Log in to the agent host.</span></li>
     <li><span>Add the corresponding domain name server to <span class="filepath"><b>/etc/resolv.conf</b></span>, or add the mapping between the IP address and name of the target host to <span class="filepath"><b>/etc/hosts</b></span>.</span></li>
