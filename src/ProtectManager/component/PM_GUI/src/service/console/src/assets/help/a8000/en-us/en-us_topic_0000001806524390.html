<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Context</h4><p>For mailbox backup, a registered user must have the <strong>ApplicationImpersonation</strong> role permissions. When the mailbox is backed up for the first time, the agent host automatically creates a user group named <strong>Databackup</strong>, which has the <strong>ApplicationImpersonation</strong> role permissions, and adds the registered user to the user group.</p>
