  <div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Fault Symptom</h4>
    <p>A full backup of GaussDB (DWS) fails, and an incremental backup is performed before elimination of the failure causes and completion of the full backup. In this case, the incremental backup fails accordingly.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Possible Cause</h4>
    <ul>
     <li>The CBM file in GaussDB (DWS) is described as follows:
      <ul>
       <li>Each time a full backup is performed, the database generates a new CBM file to record operations performed on GaussDB (DWS) after the full backup, regardless of whether the full backup is successful or whether a new full backup copy is generated.</li>
       <li>Each time a full backup is performed, the existing CBM files are deleted from the database. Even if the full backup fails, the existing CBM files are deleted when the backup job is complete.</li>
       <li>During incremental backup, the database generates an incremental backup copy based on the full backup copy and CBM file that are successfully generated last time.</li>
      </ul></li>
     <li>The causes of the incremental backup failure after the full backup failure are as follows:<p>The last full backup job 1 is successful, and full backup copy 1 is generated. The generated CBM file records the operations performed on GaussDB (DWS) after full backup job 1 is complete. When a new full backup is performed:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>If the full backup is successful, full backup copy 2 is generated. The generated CBM file records the operations performed on GaussDB (DWS) after the job of full backup copy 2 starts. In this case, if incremental backup is performed, the database generates incremental backup copies based on full backup copy 2 and the CBM file.</li>
       <li>If the full backup fails, full backup copy 2 cannot be generated. However, the CBM file generated upon completion of the job still records the operations performed on GaussDB (DWS) after full backup job 2 starts. In this case, if incremental backup is performed., the database generates incremental backup copies based on full copy 1 and the CBM file. Related operations recorded in the CBM file are discontinuous. As a result, the incremental backup fails.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Suggestion</h4>
    <p>Identify and eliminate the failure causes of the full backup on GaussDB (DWS). Then, perform an incremental backup after the full backup is complete.</p>
