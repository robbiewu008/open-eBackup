  <div>
   <p>If the client is independently deployed on production hosts, you need to add environment variables on each host where the client is deployed. Otherwise, the Roach command will fail to be executed.</p>
   <div class="section">
    <h4 class="sectiontitle">Procedure</h4>
    <ol>
     <li><span>Use PuTTY to log in to all CNs in the GaussDB (DWS) cluster where the client has been deployed.</span></li>
     <li><span>Run the following command to open the <strong>env</strong> file (user <strong>omm</strong> is used as an example):</span><p></p><pre class="screen">vi /home/<em>omm</em>/profile/env</pre>
      <div class="p">
       Ensure that the following content has been added to the <strong>env</strong> file. The client installation directory <strong>/opt</strong> is used as an example.
       <pre class="screen">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/<em>opt</em>/DataBackup/ProtectClient/interfaces/xbsa/lib</pre>
      </div> <p></p></li>
     <li><span>Run the following command to open the <strong>.bashrc</strong> file (user <strong>omm</strong> is used as an example):</span><p></p><pre class="screen">vi /home/<em>omm</em>/.bashrc</pre>
      <div class="p">
       Ensure that the following content has been added to the <strong>.bashrc</strong> file. The client installation directory <strong>/opt</strong> is used as an example.
       <pre class="screen">export DATA_BACKUP_AGENT_HOME=/<em>opt</em></pre>
