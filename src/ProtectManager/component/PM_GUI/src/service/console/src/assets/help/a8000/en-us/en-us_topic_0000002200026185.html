<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Backup</h4><ul><li>Full backup: <span id="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002200026185__en-us_topic_0000002164660658_ph48664393114">backs up the entire set of data at a specific point in time, regardless of whether the data has been modified since the last backup. In the case of large data volumes, this backup type may take a long time and occupy a large amount of backup storage space.</span></li><li><span id="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002200026185__en-us_topic_0000002164660658_ph0724454151718">Forever incremental (synthetic full) backup: backs up only the data that is added or modified since the first full backup. Compared with full backup, forever incremental (synthetic full) backup significantly improves the backup efficiency in scenarios with large data volumes. If no full backup copy exists, the first forever incremental (synthetic full) backup will be a full backup, and incremental backups are performed subsequently. Copies generated by forever incremental (synthetic full) backups are forever incremental (synthetic full) copies, which improve the restoration performance and do not occupy extra space.</span></li><li>Copy verification: verifies the integrity of a copy after the backup is complete or before the copy is used for restoration. </li><li>Source deduplication: deduplicates backup data at the source end before the data is sent to the target end. This technology saves network transmission bandwidth and storage space. Only OceanProtect X series backup appliances and OceanProtect E1000 (with the OceanProtect used as backup storage) support source deduplication.</li><li>Deduplication and compression: allows the <span id="EN-US_TOPIC_0000002200026185__en-us_topic_0000002164660658_text94229516217">OceanProtect</span> to automatically deduplicate and compress data after the data is backed up. Only OceanProtect X series backup appliances and OceanProtect E1000 support deduplication and compression.</li><li>Rate limiting policy: limits the bandwidth for backup, replication, and archive.</li><li>Automatic retry upon failure: allows the system to automatically retry if a periodic backup job fails. The number of retries ranges from 1 to 5, and the wait time ranges from 1 to 30 minutes. For example, if the number of retries is set to 3 and the wait time is set to 5 minutes, the system retries for a total of three times at an interval of 5 minutes.</li><li>Backup link encryption: encrypts transmitted data during data backup to ensure data security. Only the OceanProtect X series backup appliances and OceanProtect E1000 (OceanProtect is used as backup storage) support backup link encryption.</li></ul>
