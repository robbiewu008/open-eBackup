(Note: If an alarm is generated indicating that the OSD service on the isolated node exits, rectify the fault based on the handling suggestions and skip the step for restoring the OSD service.)<br>    2.1 Check whether read-only main storage disks exist in the disk pool. Check whether the main storage disk is read-only (RO FLAG column) by following the instructions in \"Insight Tool Usage Reference\" > \"MDC Module\" > \"Obtaining OSD View Information\" in the product documentation.<br>    2.2 If the disk pool has a read-only main storage disk (RO FLAG status is 2), perform operations by following the instructions in \"Replacing an Offline Cache Disk Module\" in the product documentation. After the fault is rectified, go to step 2.3.<br>    2.3 If all main storage disks in the disk pool are normal (RO FLAG status is 0), go to step 2.4. Otherwise, contact Huawei technical support.<br>    2.4 CLI command 1: Run the \"change disk_pool disk_status_ok pool_id=? osd_list=?\" command on any storage node where the MDC process is running properly. In the command, \"pool_id\" indicates the ID of the faulty disk pool, and \"osd_list\" indicates the ID list of faulty disks. If \"osd_list\" is not specified, all disks are restored.<br>    2.5 Diagnose command 1: On any storage node, enter the diagnose mode, run the \"attach 422\" command, and then run the \"fdsacore clusterClient ShowMaster\" command to obtain the IP address of the primary FDSA node.<br>    2.6 Diagnose command 2: Go to the primary FDSA node queried in step 2.5, enter the diagnose mode, run the \"attach 422\" command, and then run the \"fdsacore clusterMgr showClusterInfo\" command to obtain the value of \"Cm node lsid (FdsaLsid)\" corresponding to the IP address of the isolated node.<br>    2.7 Diagnose command 3: Go to the primary FDSA node queried in step 2.5, enter the diagnose mode, and run the \"attach 422\" command and then the \"fdsacore proclink show isolaterecords\" command. Obtain the value of \"ObjId\" (osdLsid) based on \"Cm node lsid (FdsaLsid)\" (queried in step 2.6) and the record where the value of \"Type\" is 2 and the value of \"Status\" is 0.<br>    2.8 Diagnose command 4: Go to the primary FDSA node queried in step 2.5, enter the diagnose mode, and run the \"attach 422\" command and then the \"fdsacore healctrl recoverOsd osdLsid\" command. (\"osdLsid\" indicates the \"osdLsid\" obtained in step 2.7) If multiple \"osdLsid\" values are obtained in step 2.7, perform step 2.8 for multiple times and enter one \"osdLsid\" value each time. Then, check whether the command is successfully executed. After the command is successfully executed, wait for the management plane to start the OSD process. (Generally, it takes 10 minutes to restore the process.)<br>Step3 Restore the MDC process. Run one CLI command and one diagnose command to restore the isolated MDC process.<br>    3.1 CLI command: Run the \"show disk_pool mdc_list\" command on any storage node where the MDC process is running properly. After the command is executed, obtain the value of \"MDCNID\" of the isolated node based on the storage IP address. (Note: If the storage IP address or \"MDCNID\" cannot be found, skip the following steps.)<br>    3.2 Diagnose command: Go to the isolated node, enter the diagnose mode, run the \"attach 422\" command and then the \"fdsacore healctrl recoverMdc mdcNid\" command (\"mdcNid\" indicates the \"mdcNid\" obtained by running the CLI command in the previous step), and check whether the command is successfully executed.<br>    3.3 If the command is executed successfully, manually clear the alarm.<br>Step4 If the preceding processes fail to be restored, collect related information and contact technical support engineers.","0xFEA623418.alarm.desc":"The service on node [ip] is permanently isolated.
